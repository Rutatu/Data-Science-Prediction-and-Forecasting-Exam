Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunications
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a fictional telecommunications company using machine learning models. The aim is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service, allowing for proactive retention strategies. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Key steps in the project involve feature selection to improve model performance and reduce complexity, as well as an evaluation of model performance using metrics such as recall, precision, F1-score, and ROC AUC. The repository includes code for model training, evaluation, and visualization of results, with a focus on understanding the most influential features driving customer churn.
